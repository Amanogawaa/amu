    ✔ Leaderboards based on the exp they get from completing lessons and courses @done(26-01-26 22:29)
    ✔ Streak calendar: Visualize learning streaks and reward consistency - maybe commit not streak? just to be different - included on the leaderboards feature @done(26-01-26 22:29)
    ☐ Progress visualization: Beautiful skill trees and learning maps -i dont know how to do this yet, how can we connect the courses that user generates based on skill level and topic? should i rely on the recommednation system for this?
    ☐ 5-minute challenges: Quick daily practice - PHASE 2: integrate with adaptive playground exercise lessons
    ✔ for quizzes - implement different types of questions like true/false, fill in the blanks, matching type, and scenario-based questions @done(26-01-26)
    ✔ Adaptive Code Playground - Phase 1: Dual Engine Support (Piston + Judge0) @done(26-01-29 09:00)
    ☐ Adaptive Code Playground - Phase 2: Frontend Framework Support (Sandpack) - IN PROGRESS
        ✔ Install Sandpack dependencies @done(26-01-29 10:00)
        ✔ Create SandpackPlayground component @done(26-01-29 10:30)
        ✔ Create AdaptivePlayground switcher component @done(26-01-29 10:30)
        ✔ Add React/Vue/Angular templates @done(26-01-29 10:15)
        ✔ Update lesson rendering to use adaptive playground @done(26-01-29 10:45)
        ☐ Test with AI-generated React lessons
        ☐ UI/UX polish and responsive design
        ☐ Performance optimization

revisions todo:
    ✔ duration concerns - remove the module/chapter feature - course -> chapter -> lesson, keep the course structure simple but rich with lessons only - @done(26-01-17 15:25)
    ☐ learning continuity - its either generate a new course or recommend an existing course but will be based on next difficulty level from previous course taken
    ✔ match number of lessons to duration of courses - dont force 4 lessons per chapter, let the ai decide based on the duration of the course, remove ung constraints in the chapter template @done(26-01-23 17:00)
    ☐ course recommendation system - based on learning style, skill level, and previous courses
    ✔ sort courses by recently generated as default with data generated indicator @done(26-01-23 16:42)

issue to fix:
    ✔ validation verification and analysis of request before generating - backend middleware to validate request data before processing (current implementation is not working as intended) @done(25-11-10 08:03)
    ✔ category limitation - limit the generation to programming and technology only. no other topics like dance, music, cooking etc. @done(25-11-10 08:03)
    ✔ time left in generation instead of percent @done(26-01-05 08:09)
    ✔ validation for checking if the same course or similar course already exists before generating a new one - middleware @done(26-01-05)

minor fix: 
    ☐ avp - revise into making a self-made animation
    ☐ project title - i dont know what to put there    

note:
    ✔ make the lesson generation flexible, while having a structure is good, but let the ai decide how many lessons are needed based on the course duration and topic @done(26-01-23 17:00)

duration concerns:
    ✔ rechecking of system and user prompt for lesson is needed - make sure the ai understands the duration and adjust the number of lessons accordingly @done(26-01-23 17:00)
    ✔ recheck the chapter template for lesson generation - remove ung constraints and make it flexible @done(26-01-23 17:00)
    ✔ frontend refactor for removing module feature - course dd-> chapter -> lesson only (pending) @done(26-01-24 13:10)

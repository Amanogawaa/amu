Issue:
  ✘ redesign the other user page @started(25-12-03 17:30) @cancelled(25-12-03 19:05) @wasted(1h35m55s)
    - when visiting other user profile, show the courses created by the user but only the published ones
    - show the number of courses created, number of students enrolled across all courses, number of reviews received, and likes (basically we can use the overview in the account page)
    - show the date when the user joined
    - show the bio of the user
  ☐ other user can update the status of the other user
  ✔ user profile page have public and private option @done(25-12-03 17:25)
  ✔ switching between public and private profile is not working as expected. the request goes thru but when refreshing the page it goes back to previous state @done(25-12-03 17:25)

- @suggestion: what are the things user can see on other user profiles?

new features to implement: 
    ☐ implement ai chatbot with context-based knowledge - ai agent that can answer questions related to the generated lesson 
    ☐ Leaderboards with context: By skill level, by topic, by learning style (optional?)
    ☐ Achievement trees: Not just badges, but skill trees showing progression
    ☐ Progress visualization: Beautiful skill trees and learning maps
    ☐ 5-minute challenges: Quick daily practice

revisions todo:
    ✔ duration concerns - remove the module/chapter feature - course -> chapter -> lesson, keep the course structure simple but rich with lessons only - @done(26-01-17 15:25)
    ☐ learning continuity - its either generate a new course or recommend an existing course but will be based on next difficulty level from previous course taken
    ☐ match number of lessons to duration of courses - dont force 4 lessons per chapter, let the ai decide based on the duration of the course, remove ung constraints in the chapter template
    ☐ course recommendation system - based on learning style, skill level, and previous courses
    ☐ sort courses by recently generated as default with data generated indicator

issue to fix:
    ✔ validation verification and analysis of request before generating - backend middleware to validate request data before processing (current implementation is not working as intended) @done(25-11-10 08:03)
    ✔ category limitation - limit the generation to programming and technology only. no other topics like dance, music, cooking etc. @done(25-11-10 08:03)
    ✔ time left in generation instead of percent @done(26-01-05 08:09)
    ✔ validation for checking if the same course or similar course already exists before generating a new one - middleware @done(26-01-05)

minor fix: 
    ☐ avp - revise into making a self-made animation
    ☐ project title - i dont know what to put there

note:
    ☐ make the lesson generation flexible, while having a structure is good, but let the ai decide how many lessons are needed based on the course duration and topic

duration concerns:
    ☐ rechecking of system and user prompt for lesson is needed - make sure the ai understands the duration and adjust the number of lessons accordingly
    ☐ recheck the chapter template for lesson generation - remove ung constraints and make it flexible
    ☐ frontend refactor for removing module feature - course -> chapter -> lesson only (pending)
